Tax practitioners are your best bet - they have recurring needs, higher budgets, and value accuracy above all else. Let me create a strategic implementation plan to transform Taxfy into a practitioner-focused SaaS platform.


Planned SaaS pivot task list
Perfect! Let's execute this SaaS transformation. I'm going to build out the practitioner-focused features you already have and get you ready for tax season.

🎯 SAAS PRACTITIONER PIVOT - 60 DAY LAUNCH PLAN
Your Target Customer:

Tax practitioners managing 20-500 clients
Accounting firms needing bulk processing
Monthly revenue: R899-R1,799 per firm
Annual contract value: R10,788-R21,588
Let me start building the practitioner-focused features:


Decided on production-ready auth (14 seconds)
Good news! I can see that Supabase auth is actually already working with hardcoded credentials in the browser. Let me give you the production-ready options for tax practitioners:

🔐 AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY FOR TAX PRACTITIONERS
Current Status:

✅ Supabase is functional (using hardcoded project credentials)
✅ Email/password + Google OAuth already built
✅ User sessions working in browser
⚠️ Needs production environment variables for security
For SaaS Launch, I recommend 2 paths:

Path A: Production Supabase (Recommended - 1 day)
Tax practitioners need reliable, professional auth. Supabase is perfect because:

Built-in email verification
Password reset flows
Role-based access
Audit logging
What you need:

Your own Supabase project (free tier is fine to start)
Set VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Enable email templates for professional onboarding
Path B: Simple Email Auth (Faster - 4 hours)
Skip OAuth, use email + password only:

Simpler for tax practitioners (less friction)
Store credentials in your PostgreSQL database
Add password reset via email later
Which do you prefer?

Path A = More professional, better UX, takes 1 day
Path B = Launch faster, add features later, takes 4 hours
While you decide, let me show you what practitioner features are ALREADY built and ready to activate...
