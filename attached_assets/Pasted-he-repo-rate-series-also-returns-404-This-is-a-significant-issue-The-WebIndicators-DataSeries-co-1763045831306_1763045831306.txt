he repo rate series also returns 404! This is a significant issue. The /WebIndicators/DataSeries/{code} endpoint is returning 404 for all series codes, which means either:

The endpoint structure is incorrect
The SARB API doesn't support this endpoint anymore
The series codes are wrong
But wait - the repo rate IS working via the CPD rates endpoint. So the SARB API is accessible, but the DataSeries endpoint specifically is the problem.

This is a critical finding. The SARB Web API might not support the /WebIndicators/DataSeries/{code} endpoint, or it requires a different format.

Let me search for SARB API documentation to understand the correct endpoint structure. Actually, let me try accessing the SARB API directly to see what happens.

Actually, looking at my code in sarb-api.ts, the comment says "This endpoint structure needs verification - use getCPDRates() for reliable data". This suggests that the DataSeries endpoint was never fully verified.

The CPD rates endpoint works (repo rate is successfully fetched), but the time series endpoint doesn't. This explains why:

Repo rate: ✅ Works (via CPDRates endpoint)
Prime rate: ✅ Works (calculated from repo rate)
Inflation (CPI): ❌ Fails (requires DataSeries endpoint)
Exchange rates: ❌ Fail (requires DataSeries endpoint)
This is a major issue! The SARB API integration is only 40% complete (2 out of 5 indicators working).

Let me do a web search to find the correct SARB API documentation and endpoint structure for time series data.

I've discovered a critical issue: the SARB DataSeries endpoint is returning 404 for all series! This explains why CPI and FX data are using fallbacks. Let me search for the correct SARB API documentation:
