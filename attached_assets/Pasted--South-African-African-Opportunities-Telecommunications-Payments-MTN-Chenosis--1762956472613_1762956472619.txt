## International Examples for Inspiration

While not directly usable in SA, these show what types of utility APIs exist globally:

**Energy/Utility Companies:**

- European electricity grid operators (Elia, TenneT, Fingrid) offer open APIs for power generation, load data, and market prices[[9]](https://www.elia.be/en/grid-data/open-data)[[10]](https://developer.tennet.eu/specs)
- Australian and New Zealand energy markets have open electricity data APIs[[11]](https://docs.openelectricity.org.au/api-reference/overview)

**Government API Marketplaces:**

- Singapore's APEX platform (3000+ government APIs)[[12]](https://www.apex.gov.sg/)
- India's API Setu (thousands of APIs for KYC, admissions, employment)[[13]](https://apisetu.gov.in/)
- UAE API Marketplace for government services[[14]](https://u.ae/en/about-the-uae/digital-uae/digital-transformation/platforms-and-apps/uae-api-marketplace)

## Monetization Ideas

Based on these APIs, here are app concepts you could build:

1. **Payment/Financial Apps** - Use MTN MoMo, Stitch, or Nedbank APIs to build payment solutions, expense trackers, or financial management tools
2. **Communication Services** - Africa's Talking APIs for bulk SMS services, notification systems, or customer engagement platforms
3. **Data Aggregation** - Combine multiple utility data sources (like your Eskom idea) to provide insights and alerts
4. **Business Tools** - Build invoicing, payroll, or business management tools using fintech APIs

The key is finding APIs where:

- Data is valuable but not easily accessible
- You can add value through aggregation, analysis, or alerts
- There's a clear customer willing to pay for the convenience

Your Eskom load-shedding alert app fits this perfectly - it takes public data and makes it actionable for users who need timely notifications.
